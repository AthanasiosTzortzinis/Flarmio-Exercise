A simple web application that takes user input for a number and ensures that the entered number is greater than 10. It uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Features
The application displays:

A label "Form" on the left.
A label "Number" with a slight distance to the right of the "Form" label.
An input field below the "Number" label where users can input a number.
A "Submit" button to submit the entered value.
If the user tries to submit a number less than or equal to 10, a message is shown: "Please enter a number bigger than 10."

The button is clickable even when the input is invalid, and the message is shown immediately when hovering over the submit button.

Upon submitting a valid number (greater than 10), a prompt message confirms successful submission.

# Technologies Used
HTML: The structure of the web page.
CSS: The styles and layout of the page.
JavaScript: Handles validation logic for user input
